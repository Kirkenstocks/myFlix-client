# myFlix

## Description:
This is the client side of a movie database SPA that allows users to look up information about included movies, create a profile, and save favorite movies to their profile. The backend code can be found in my movie_api repository.

## Dependencies and Technologies:
This app was built with React and utilizes React-Bootstrap for styling. It utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack along with the backend I created in the movie_api repository, and represents my first full-stack application! Live hosting is provided by Netlify.

## How to Run:
If you want to run the application locally, download the repository, navigate to the project directory, and enter the command:
`npm parcel src/index.html`
or you can use the script:
`npm run start`
Alternatively, you can visit the live hosted app at:
